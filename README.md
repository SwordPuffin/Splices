 A word making game
</p>

# How To Play

There are three modes: length, free play, and timed. The goal in length mode is to maximise the length of the words available given a limited number of guesses. Free play has no maximum word count or timer, unlike timed which (obviously) has a limited time frame. Modes can be changed with the game controller icon in the top right

# Keybinds

Spacebar - Enter completed word (or not completed word to delete it)

s - Stop or start a game

Ctl-q - Exit

Ctl-? - Show keyboard shortcuts
